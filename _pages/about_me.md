## Bio
I am an incoming fifth-year PhD student in department of [Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.mst.edu/) at Missouri University of Science and Technology. 

Before commencing my PhD, I completed my master in [Management Science and Technology](https://sem.tongji.edu.cn/semen/programs/postgraduate) at [Tongji university](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/eng/), where my focus was on Data Science. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor degree in [Engineering Management](https://english.bucea.edu.cn/) from Beijing University of Science and Technology in 2015.

I have full-time work experience in the financial industry as a data scientist. At [Finsight]([Fantaike](http://www.fantaike.ai/)), I developed an application scorecard to support auto-loan approvals for car financing. At [Surfin](https://www.surfin-cn.com/), I design strategies to reduce default rates for overseas loans.

In the summer of 2018, I interned as a business data analyst at [Didi](https://web.didiglobal.com/) in Beijing, China, where I conducted data analysis and collaborate with project manager for a new type of car service.

Outside of work, I enjoy painting, going to the gym, and singing.
