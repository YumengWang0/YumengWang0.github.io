Hi there! My name is Yumeng (pronunciation: similar to ‚ÄúYoomung‚Äù). I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student advised by [Dr. Yanzhi Zhang](https://web.mst.edu/~zhangyanz/) in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.mst.edu/) at **Missouri University of Science and Technology**, with a strong background in **applied mathematics, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence**.

My research interests lie in the intersection of **deep learning** and **computational mathematics**. Specifically, I am exploring the deep learning algorithm to address challenges in computational mathematics (PDEs), with a broad application in digital twins and control problem, including area: 

- **Scientific machine learning (AI4PDE)** 
- **Neural operators & foundation models for PDEs**
- **Reduced-order modeling**
- **Generative modeling**
- **Numerical algorithms in solving PDEs**

Beyond my research in scientific machine learning, I have a solid foundation in **general machine learning** and **applied AI**. I have hands-on experience with core ML algorithms, as well as modern techniques in **computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning**. Besides, my background spans on the **industry applications**, including credit scoring, time-series forecasting, and large-scale data analytics‚Äîdemonstrating a broad and adaptable ML skill set.
