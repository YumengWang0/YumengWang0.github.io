Hi there! My name is Yumeng (pronunciation similar to "Yoomung"). I am currently a fifth-year PhD student in Computational and Applied Mathematics at Missouri University of Science and Technology (MST). I joined the department of [Mathematics and Statistic](https://math.mst.edu/) in 2021, where I have been advised by Professor [Yanzhi Zhang](https://web.mst.edu/~zhangyanz/).

My research focuses on **Artificial Intelligence for Partial Differential Equations (AI4PDE)**. I am particularly interested in leveraging deep learning techniques—including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative models, and transformer-based architectures—for modeling complex spatiotemporal data governed by PDEs.

My work addresses challenges where traditional numerical methods struggle, with emphasis on:
- Understanding and forecasting PDE dynamics.  
- Developing neural network-based **reduced-order models (ROMs)**.
- Learning mappings in infinite-dimensional function spaces through **neural operator learning**.
- Learning mappings in the reduced spaces through  **neural operator learning**.
